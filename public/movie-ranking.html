<h3>Moonlight</h3>
    <p>This is honestly one of the most beautiful movies of all time. It's very personal to me and it always an emotional experience to watch</p>
<h3>Homecoming</h3>
    <p>The greatest concert film of all time, buy the greatest performer of all time. The Queen Mother of the House of Renaissance, Beyonce Giselle Knowles-Carter</p>
<h3>Paddington 2</h3>
    <p>My feel good movie. Whenever I feel down, this movie never fails to make me feel better. But I watch it sparingly because I don't want it to lose it's magic.
<h3>Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse</h3>
    <p>An animated masterpiece. Spiderman has always been my favorite superhero because I feel like I am him lol. It's also a great story about the responsibility of being a hero.</p>
